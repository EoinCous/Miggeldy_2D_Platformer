Recreate the platforms x position to match the repainted platforms
Implement collision detection on all of the platforms (is there a better way than looping through every platform?)
Create a list of platforms which are above the ground. Gravity will change to the platforms once player is above
Store power-ups across the level which changes the players animation and speed / jump height
Player can die and reset to the start if falls down through hole
