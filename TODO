Recreate the platforms x position to match the repainted platforms
(is there a collision detection method better than looping through every platform?)
Store power-ups across the level which changes the players animation and speed / jump height
Player can die and reset to the start if falls down through hole
Add enemies
Change animations depending what way the character is moving (setTextureLocation)
