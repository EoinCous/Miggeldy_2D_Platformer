### Gameplay
The objective of the game is to progress through the levels, collect power-ups, and reach the end goal without running out of lives. You start with 3 lives, and each time you fall into a pit or get hit by an obstacle, you lose a life. If you lose all your lives, the game is over and you have to start from the beginning.

In each level, you have to navigate through platforms, avoid obstacles such as spikes, and collect power-ups such as coins and extra lives. At the end of each level, you will encounter a checkpoint that you need to reach to proceed to the next level.

#### Multiplayer Mode
Miggeldy also features a multiplayer mode where two players can play together using the arrow keys. In this mode, the objective is the same as in single-player mode, but you have a another player to help.
